# Chapter 13 Quiz: Capstone Autonomous Butler Project

Test your knowledge of designing, integrating, and evaluating an autonomous humanoid butler.

## Questions

1.  **Which of the following is NOT listed as a core capability of the Autonomous Butler?**
    a) Voice Command Understanding
    b) Environment Mapping & Localization
    c) Dexterous Manipulation
    d) Advanced Machine Learning Model Development
    **Answer**: d) Advanced Machine Learning Model Development

2.  **In the high-level system architecture, what is the primary role of the "World Model"?**
    a) To directly control the robot's actuators.
    b) To translate voice commands into text.
    c) To aggregate sensor data and maintain a consistent understanding of the environment and robot state.
    d) To plan high-level task sequences.
    **Answer**: c) To aggregate sensor data and maintain a consistent understanding of the environment and robot state.

3.  **For long-running, cancellable tasks with feedback in ROS 2, which communication mechanism is most appropriate?**
    a) ROS 2 Topics
    b) ROS 2 Services
    c) ROS 2 Actions
    d) ROS 2 Parameters
    **Answer**: c) ROS 2 Actions

4.  **When implementing the Task Planner module, which design pattern is recommended for handling success, failure, and recovery attempts?**
    a) A simple sequential list of commands.
    b) A reactive behavior tree.
    c) A finite state machine (FSM).
    d) Direct end-to-end learning.
    **Answer**: c) A finite state machine (FSM).

5.  **Which module would typically be responsible for breaking down a high-level command like "Go to kitchen, pick up cup, bring to living room" into a sequence of navigation and manipulation goals?**
    a) Perception Module
    b) VLA Integration Module
    c) Task Planner Module
    d) Voice Handler Module
    **Answer**: c) Task Planner Module

6.  **If the robot attempts to grasp an object but consistently fails because the object is not found, what is a recommended fallback strategy mentioned?**
    a) Immediately stop all operations.
    b) Attempt recovery by searching a wider area.
    c) Ask the user for a new command.
    d) Ignore the failure and proceed to the next step.
    **Answer**: b) Attempt recovery by searching a wider area.

7.  **Which of the following ROS 2 packages would be responsible for global and local path planning, as well as obstacle avoidance?**
    a) `capstone_perception`
    b) `capstone_navigation`
    c) `capstone_manipulation`
    d) `capstone_vla_integration`
    **Answer**: b) `capstone_navigation`

8.  **What is the purpose of the `capstone_world_model` module?**
    a) To perform speech-to-text conversion.
    b) To run VLA model inference.
    c) To track known objects, their properties, and the robot's current pose.
    d) To generate joint commands for the arm.
    **Answer**: c) To track known objects, their properties, and the robot's current pose.

9.  **When evaluating the Butler's "Task Planning & Execution" capability, what would be a measurable success criterion?**
    a) The robot can move its arm smoothly.
    b) The robot can transcribe voice commands with 95% accuracy.
    c) The robot can execute 3-step sequential tasks reliably.
    d) The robot can identify 5 different object types.
    **Answer**: c) The robot can execute 3-step sequential tasks reliably.

10. **Why is it important to approach the capstone project iteratively, testing each component and sub-system before full integration?**
    a) To reduce the total number of code lines.
    b) To make the project easier to document.
    c) To simplify debugging and isolate issues, building complexity gradually.
    d) To ensure that all modules are written in the same programming language.
    **Answer**: c) To simplify debugging and isolate issues, building complexity gradually.
