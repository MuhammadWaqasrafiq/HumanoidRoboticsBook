# Chapter 12 Quiz: Sim-to-Real Transfer

Test your knowledge of the critical techniques and best practices for bridging the reality gap and deploying policies from simulation to real-world robots.

## Questions

1.  **What is the "reality gap" in the context of robotics?**
    a) The difference in cost between simulated and real robots.
    b) The discrepancy between policies trained in simulation and their performance in the real world.
    c) The time delay between a robot's perception and its action.
    d) The ethical concerns surrounding AI in physical systems.
    **Answer**: b) The discrepancy between policies trained in simulation and their performance in the real world.

2.  **Which of the following is NOT a primary source of the reality gap?**
    a) Physics discrepancies (e.g., contact models).
    b) Sensor discrepancies (e.g., noise characteristics).
    c) Computational power differences between sim and real.
    d) Modeling errors (e.g., URDF/SDF inaccuracies).
    **Answer**: c) Computational power differences between sim and real.

3.  **What is the main goal of Domain Randomization (DR)?**
    a) To make the simulation perfectly photorealistic.
    b) To train policies to be invariant to variations between sim and real.
    c) To reduce the computational cost of simulation.
    d) To generate synthetic data for human supervised learning.
    **Answer**: b) To train policies to be invariant to variations between sim and real.

4.  **Which type of parameter would you NOT typically randomize in Visual Domain Randomization?**
    a) Textures and lighting.
    b) Camera position and field of view.
    c) The robot's joint limits.
    d) Object colors and materials.
    **Answer**: c) The robot's joint limits.

5.  **When quantifying the reality gap, what does a "Policy Success Rate Drop" metric of >25% typically indicate?**
    a) The simulation is too complex.
    b) The real robot is underperforming due to mechanical failure.
    c) There is a significant reality gap that needs to be addressed.
    d) The policy is too simple for the task.
    **Answer**: c) There is a significant reality gap that needs to be addressed.

6.  **In the Teacher-Student Distillation Workflow for Unitree robots, what kind of information does the "Teacher Policy" typically have access to that the "Student Policy" does not?**
    a) Real-world sensor data.
    b) Privileged information (e.g., exact contact forces).
    c) Only non-privileged information.
    d) The robot's battery level.
    **Answer**: b) Privileged information (e.g., exact contact forces).

7.  **When deploying a navigation policy to a Jetson Economy Tier, which optimization technique is crucial for maximizing inference speed on the Jetson's GPU?**
    a) Increasing the model's complexity.
    b) Using float32 precision for all calculations.
    c) Exporting the policy to an ONNX or TensorRT engine.
    d) Running all inference on the CPU.
    **Answer**: c) Exporting the policy to an ONNX or TensorRT engine.
